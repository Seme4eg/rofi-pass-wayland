#+title: rofi-pass-wayland

A [[https://github.com/lbonn/rofi][rofi-wayland]] frontend for [[http://www.passwordstore.org/][ZX2C4 pass project]]. The original repo is not very
actively maintained to i decided to give it a go.

Main goal - provide needed frontend features for pass and sane codebase while
still keeping it just a bash script that you can just use on its own. Good old copy-paste-use.

_Features_:
- Create / Read / Update / Delete / move / copy password store entries
- Generate new passwords for entries
- Copy / type individual fields (or autotype based on ~autotype~ field) of selected entry
- Support for different password store roots (e.g. personal & work)
- Open URLs of entries with hotkey
- Generate and display QR code directly in rofi ([[https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/][qrencode]] needed).
- Generate and autotype in OTPs
- Extensive configuration (see [[config.example]])

Use default binding ~Alt+h~ to see available bindings. And pass ~--help | -h~ flag to
this script to see all available flags.

** Dependencies
- [[http://www.passwordstore.org/][ZX2C4 pass]]
- [[https://github.com/lbonn/rofi][rofi-wayland]]
- wtype
- wl-clipboard
- [[https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/][qrencode]] (optional: for generating and displaying pass qrcode)
- [[https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp][pass-otp]] (optional: for OTPs)

** Configuration
Presedence:
- ~ROFI_PASS_CONFIG~ env var. You can set the environment variable like this:
  ~ROFI_PASS_CONFIG="/path/to/config" rofi-pass~
- =$HOME/.config/rofi-pass/config=
- internal default values

See example configuration in [[config.example]] file.

** Autotyping
Default autotype value is ~user :tab pass~. In case you don't have ~user:~
field in your password file it will take value of ~default_user~ from your
config (defaults to output of command ~whoami~). Or you can set
~default_user~ to ~:basename~ and autotype will always type basename of
password file as username. (i.e. for ~foo/bar/site.com/jack~ it will type
~jack~ as  username)

Example of password store file with autotyping of more than one field, using the
~autotype~ entry:

#+begin_src sh
# mail/gmail/john@gmail.com
de_password
user: MyUser
SomeField: foobar
AnotherField: barfoo
url: http://my.url.foo
# self-explanatory - :tab, :space (might be useful for checkboxes), :enter
# :delay - sleep before proceeding further
# :otp - generate and type an OTP
# path - fill in path of that password entry (in this case
#   mail/gmail/john@gmail.com)
autotype: SomeField :tab user :tab AnotherField :tab pass :space :enter
#+end_src

** OTP
The format for OTPs should either compatible with =pass-otp(1)= -
~otpauth://[...]~.

Or it should define a method for generating OTPs:

: otp_method: /opt/obscure-otp-generator/oog --some-option some args

** FAQ
*** rofi pass hangs after selecting password
To access passwords your GPG agent needs to have unlocked your secret key you're
using to encrypt your passwords with. If the secret key hasn't been unlocked yet
it will prompt for the secret key password using ~pinentry~. If ~pinentry~ is
configured to read from a ~tty~ then ~rofi-pass~ will hang indefinitely. To fix this
you need to [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GnuPG#pinentry][configure gpg]] to use a gui version of ~pinentry~. Afterwards you may
have to kill the GPG agent if it's still in a bad state: ~killall -9 gpg-agent~.
** Todos [0/2]
*** TODO pass grep urls
Instead of previous bookmarks functionality utilize 'pass grep $url_field' to
grep and output all urls of the password store
